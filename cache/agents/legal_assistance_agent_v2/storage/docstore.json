Order for custody and disposal of pr operty pending trial in certain cases. \u2014When any property is \nproduced before any Criminal Court during any inquiry or trial, the Court may make such order as it thinks fit for \nthe proper custody of such property pending the conclusion of the inquiry or tria l, and, if the property is subject to \nspeedy and natural decay, or if it is otherwise expedient so to do, the Court may, after recording such evidence as it \nthinks necessary, order it to be sold or otherwise disposed of.  \nExplanation. \u2014For the purposes of th is section, \u201cproperty \u201d includes \u2014 \n(a) property of any kind or document which is produced before the C ourt or which is in its custody;  \n(b) any property regarding which an offence appears to have been committed or which appears to have \nbeen used for the commi ssion of any offence.  \n452. Order for disposal of property at conclusion of trial. \u2014(1) When an inquiry or trial in any Criminal \nCourt is concluded, the Court may make such order as it thinks fit for the disposal, by destruction, confiscation or \ndelivery to any person claiming to be entitled to possession thereof or otherwise, of any property or document \nproduced before it or in its custody, or regarding which any offence appears to have been committed, or which has \nbeen used for the commission of any offence . \n(2) An order may be made under sub -section (1) for the delivery of any property to any person claiming to be \nentitled to the possession thereof, without any condition or on condition that he executes a bond, with or without \nsecurities, to the satisfactio n of the Court, engaging to restore such property to the Court if the order made under \nsub-section (1) is modified or set aside on appeal or revision.  \n(3) A Court of Session may, instead of itself making an order under sub -section (1), direct the property to be \ndelivered to the Chief Judicial Magistrate, who shall thereupon deal with it in the manner provided in sections 457, \n458 and 459.  \n(4) Except where the property is livestock or is subject to speedy and natural decay, or where a bond has been \nexecuted in pursuance of sub -section (2), an order made under sub -section (1) shall not be carried out for two \nmonths, or when an appeal is presented, until such appeal has been disposed of.  \n(5) In this section, the term \u201cproperty \u201d includes, in the case of property  regarding which an offence appears to \nhave been committed, not only such property as has been originally in the possession or under the control of any \nparty, but also any property into or for which the same may have  been converted or exchanged, and anythi ng \nacquired by such  conversion or  exchange, whether immediately or otherwise.  \n453. Payment to innocent purchaser of money found on accused. \u2014When any person is convicted of any \noffence which includes, or amounts to, theft or receiving stolen property, and i t is proved that  any other person \nbought the stolen property from him without knowing  or  having reason to believe  that the same was stolen, and \nthat any money has on his arrest been taken out of the possession of  the convicted person, the Court may, on t he \napplication of such purchaser and on the restitution of the stolen property to the person  entitled to the possession \nthereof, order that out of such money a sum not exceeding the price paid by such purchaser be delivered to him.  \n454.

Destruction of libellous and other matter. \u2014(1) On a conviction under section 292, section 293, section \n501 or section 502 of the Indian Pen al Code (45 of 1860), the Court may order the destruction of all the copies of the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "35aa70f1-354a-41b7-bc91-f50fda51cc1c": {"__data__": {"id_": "35aa70f1-354a-41b7-bc91-f50fda51cc1c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "189", "file_name": "ipc1973.pdf", "file_path": "ipc1973.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1879339, "creation_date": "2024-02-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-07"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f7ff26db-f0e9-44bf-94d9-837ce9b24406", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "189", "file_name": "ipc1973.pdf", "file_path": "ipc1973.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1879339, "creation_date": "2024-02-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-07"}, "hash": "2a99525b5fc88ca293931ec6f162c4d7b205f3b659e6e78715131b9c62070131", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6c8e1890-512c-4a81-93c9-3336b9af1a8b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "188", "file_name": "ipc1973.pdf", "file_path": "ipc1973.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1879339, "creation_date": "2024-02-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-07"}, "hash": "200d2b43686102a801b4d4e3aa68618e606669a1d6fdd122ac7aa1bde150dd4e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c8aacb3e-1bc5-4759-96b7-02fee6b9bf97", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "190", "file_name": "ipc1973.pdf", "file_path": "ipc1973.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1879339, "creation_date": "2024-02-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-01", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-07"}, "hash": "adb6c2d52d1a9e0f3c9a096d0c461ac07ef3b7b9a1bfdfa4d760797b58262faf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "4b4123eebff97fcfa167bd9c0aae809e5b0f1f1d32a44dbfdb21cba33083e9d0", "text": "189 \n thing in respect of which the conviction was had, and which are  in the custody of the Court or remain in the \npossession or power of the person convicted.  \n(2) The Court may, in like manner, on a conviction under section 272, section 273, section 274 or section 275 of \nthe Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860), order the food, drink, drug or medical preparation in respect of which the \nconviction was had, to be destroyed.  \n456.

The Code provides for a mechanism for conductingtrials in a criminal case. It gives the procedure for registering a complaint, conducting atrial and passing an order, and filing an appeal against any order.\n2. Fast and efficient justice system is an essential component of good governance.\nHowever, delay in delivery of justice due to complex legal procedures, large pendency of\ncases in the Courts, low conviction rates, low level of uses of technology in legal system,delays in investigation system, complex procedures, inadequate use of forensics are thebiggest hurdles in speedy delivery of justice, which impacts poor man adversely. In order toaddress these issues a citizens centric criminal procedures are need of hour.\n3. The experience of seven decades of Indian democracy calls for comprehensive\nreview of our criminal laws, including the Code of Criminal Procedure and adopt them inaccordance with the contemporary needs and aspirations of the people.\n4. The Government with the mantra, \"Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas and\nSabka Prayas\" is committed to ensure speedy justice to all citizens in conformity with theseconstitutional democratic aspirations. The Government is committed to make comprehensivereview of the framework of criminal laws to provide accessible and speedy justice to all.\n5. In view of the above, it is proposed to repeal the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973\nand enact a new law, namely, the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023. It provides forthe use of technology and forensic sciences in the investigation of crime and furnishing andlodging of information, service of summons, etc., through electronic communication. Specifictime-lines have been prescribed for time bound investigation, trial and pronouncement ofjudgements. Citizen centric approach have been adopted for supply of copy of first informationreport to the victim and to inform them about the progress of investigation, including bydigital means. In cases where the punishment is seven years or more, the victim shall begiven an opportunity of being heard before withdrawal of the case by the Government.Summary trial has been made mandatory for petty and less serious cases. The accusedpersons may be examined through electronic means, like video conferencing. The magisterialsystem has also been streamlined.\n6. The Notes on Clauses explains the various provisions of the Bill.7. The Bill seeks to achieve the above objectives.\nN\nEW DELHI;\nThe 9th August , 2023.
